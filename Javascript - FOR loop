//For loops
//Repeats some code for a CERTAIN amount of times


//three things to INCLUDE in the condition of the FOR loop
//1) Counter
//2)Condition
//3)Increment
//The counter variable is a local variable INSIDE the for loop condition

for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1){
    console.log(i);
}

for(let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2){// changed it to i -= 2 so it counts down by two instead
    console.log(i);
}
