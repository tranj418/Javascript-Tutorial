// Variable scope

// Let = variables are limited to block scope{}
// Var = variables are LIMITED to a FUNCTION(){}

}


//console.log(i);// I is declared in the for loop, trying to access it OUTSIDE of the FOR loop throws an error
// "var name" is NOT defined
//Unless you declare the variable name with VAR, remember if used in a FUNCTION, then it does NOT exist outisde of it


//If global, VAR will change browser's window properties
//Type WINDOW into the browser console and then press "Enter"

//var name ='Jim';
//This will cause you to change the windows property of NAME from defaukt "" to JIM

let name = 'Jim';
//If you use LET then it will NOT cause the windows property of NAME
